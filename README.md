# CPLEX_CPP
A few examples of how to use CPLEX in C++ on very classic optimization problems.


It was basically asked during a TD session, in the MPRO (Master Parisien de Recherche Operationnelle).

I will enrich it, from time to time, as I try to make more models with CPLEX library for C++. The main update should be the use of a callback on every node of CPLEX branch & bound algorithm to add some cuts. If you know more about how to do it, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail, any form of help is welcome.
